# Tea-Cozy

<a href="https://user5142.github.io/Tea-Cozy/">Tea Cozy</a> is a project I completed as part of the <a href="https://join.codecademy.com/learn/paths/full-stack-engineer-career-path/">Codecademy Full Stack Engineer Path</a> course.

The task was to create a simple one-page website for a fictitious tea shop based on the following design spec:

My goal for this project was to replicate and adhere to the provided design spec as closely as possible. I didn't worry about things like responsiveness or hover states and focused only on the specific design spec requests. 

Shortly after diving in, I hit some initial roadblocks and couldn't seem to find the right solutions via Google. 

Everything clicked, however, when I turned to the Codecademy forums. I found numerous posts from people who had also struggled with this project, as well as those offering help and their own completed project solutions.

This was a key insight for me, and one of the biggest learning lessons from this project. Searching in the right places and finding optimal sources of information seems to be a force multiplier for the success and sanity of a development project. I also learned a lot about how to apply CSS Flexbox techniques, create various different styles of navigation bars, and replicate a design spec down to the pixel level.

Overrall, I am very satisfied with the <a href="https://user5142.github.io/Tea-Cozy/">end result</a> and enjoyed working on this project.
